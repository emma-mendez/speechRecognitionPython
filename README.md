Speech To Taxt


I will be working on gathering the file data from the post-request and analysing it with the speech recognition module.

I will be utilizing an [open speech repo](http://www.voiptroubleshooter.com/open_speech/american.html) for inital voice wav samples to test my code with.

Using Pypi' speech recognition API' - also great for other powerful platforms and APIs I will be using, from this site - [Appllying google cloud to convert audiofile to text](https://pypi.org/project/SpeecRecognition/)
